## Cicada Challenge

This repository contains the source code for a Cicada's Job Application. Were the main goal was to create a simple web application that allows a user to visualize currency prices, exchange rates and trends for several currency pairs.

It was build with simplicity in mind, using the least amount of dependencies possible.

I choose to use the [Atomic Design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) to structure the project, as it allows for a more scalable and maintainable codebase.
TailwindCSS was used to speed up the development process, as it allows for a more rapid prototyping and styling.
Chart.js was used to create the charts, it is a very simple and easy to use library, that is very well documented.
And finally, React Query was used to handle the data fetching. It allows for a more declarative approach to data fetching, and it also provides a lot of useful features, such as caching and automatic refetching.
